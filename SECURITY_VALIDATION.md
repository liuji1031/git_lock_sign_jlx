# Enhanced Security Validation for Git Lock Sign Extension

## Overview

The git-based notebook locking and signing extension now includes comprehensive security validation to ensure that only authorized users can unlock notebooks. This document outlines the security measures implemented.

## Security Validation Layers

### 1. Content Integrity Validation
- **Hash Verification**: Validates that notebook content hasn't been modified since locking
- **Metadata Consistency**: Ensures signature metadata is intact and valid
- **Automatic Hash Recalculation**: Handles cases where metadata changes during reload processes

### 2. User Identity Validation
- **Git User Matching**: Current git user.name and user.email must exactly match the original signer
- **Strict Identity Check**: No unlock is permitted if user identities don't match
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides specific feedback about identity mismatches

### 3. GPG Key Validation (for GPG-signed notebooks)
- **GPG Availability Check**: Ensures GPG is installed and configured for the current user
- **Signing Key Verification**: Confirms the user has access to GPG signing keys
- **Signature Verification**: Validates that the current user can verify the original commit signature
- **Private Key Access**: Ensures the user has the private key that was used to sign the original commit

## Implementation Details

### User Identity Validation Process

```python
# Get current user info
unlocking_user = self.user_service.get_user_info()

# Get original signer from metadata
original_user_name = signature_metadata.get('user_name')
original_user_email = signature_metadata.get('user_email')

# Strict validation
if (unlocking_user['name'] != original_user_name or 
    unlocking_user['email'] != original_user_email):
    # Unlock denied with 403 Forbidden
    return error_response
```

### Enhanced GPG Key Validation Process

```python
if was_gpg_signed:
    # Step 1: Check GPG availability
    if not self.gpg_service.is_gpg_available():
        return error_response
    
    if not self.gpg_service.has_signing_key():
        return error_response
    
    # Step 2: Extract original signing key ID from commit
    original_signing_key_id = self.git_service.get_commit_signing_key_id(
        abs_notebook_path, commit_hash
    )
    
    if not original_signing_key_id:
        return error_response
    
    # Step 3: Check current git signing key configuration
    current_configured_key = self.gpg_service.get_configured_signing_key()
    
    if not current_configured_key:
        return error_response
    
    # Step 4: Verify key IDs match
    keys_match = (
        current_configured_key == original_signing_key_id or
        current_configured_key.endswith(original_signing_key_id) or
        original_signing_key_id.endswith(current_configured_key)
    )
    
    if not keys_match:
        return error_response
    
    # Step 5: Test actual signing capability with original key
    can_sign_with_original_key = self.gpg_service.can_sign_with_key(original_signing_key_id)
    
    if not can_sign_with_original_key:
        return error_response
    
    # Step 6: Final signature verification
    signature_valid, verify_error = self.git_service.verify_commit_signature(
        abs_notebook_path, commit_hash
    )
    
    if not signature_valid:
        return error_response
```

## Security Error Responses

### User Identity Mismatch (HTTP 403)
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock: Current git user (John Doe <john@example.com>) does not match original signer (Jane Smith <jane@example.com>). Only the original signer can unlock this notebook."
}
```

### GPG Not Available (HTTP 403)
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: GPG is not available. Please ensure GPG is installed and configured."
}
```

### GPG Key Configuration Missing (HTTP 403)

**For Matching Users (Identity Verified):**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: No git signing key configured. Please configure a GPG key ending in 12345678 with: git config user.signingkey [YOUR_KEY_ID]"
}
```

**For Non-Matching Users:**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: You do not have access to the required GPG key. Please ensure you are the original signer with proper GPG configuration."
}
```

### GPG Key Mismatch (HTTP 403)

**For Matching Users (Identity Verified):**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: Git signing key mismatch. Original commit was signed with key ending in 12345678, but current git configuration uses key ending in 87654321. Please configure the correct key with: git config user.signingkey [YOUR_KEY_ID]"
}
```

**For Non-Matching Users:**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: Git signing key configuration does not match. Please ensure you are the original signer with the correct GPG key configured."
}
```

### GPG Private Key Access Denied (HTTP 403)

**For Matching Users (Identity Verified):**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: You do not have the private key ending in 12345678 required to unlock this notebook. Please ensure you have access to the correct GPG private key."
}
```

**For Non-Matching Users:**
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot unlock GPG-signed notebook: You do not have access to the required private key. Only the user with access to the original signing key can unlock this notebook."
}
```

## Git Configuration Priority

The system follows git's standard configuration hierarchy:

1. **Local Repository Config** (highest priority)
   - `.git/config` in the repository
   - `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`

2. **Global User Config** (fallback)
   - `~/.gitconfig`
   - `git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email`

3. **System Config** (lowest priority)
   - System-wide git configuration

## Security Benefits

### 1. Prevents Unauthorized Access
- Only the original signer can unlock their notebooks
- Protects against identity spoofing attempts
- Ensures accountability in collaborative environments

### 2. Maintains Cryptographic Integrity
- GPG signature validation ensures the unlock request comes from someone with the private key
- Prevents unlock attempts by users who don't have proper cryptographic credentials

### 3. Audit Trail
- All unlock attempts are logged with detailed user information
- Failed unlock attempts are recorded with specific failure reasons
- Successful unlocks record the unlocking user's identity

### 4. Compliance Support
- Strict identity validation supports regulatory requirements
- Cryptographic validation provides non-repudiation
- Detailed logging supports audit requirements

## Configuration Requirements

### For Basic Unlock (Non-GPG)
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### For GPG-Signed Notebook Unlock
```bash
# Git user configuration
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# GPG configuration
git config user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
git config commit.gpgsign true

# Ensure GPG key is available
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

## Testing Security Validation

### Test Case 1: Valid User Unlock
- Same git user.name and user.email as original signer
- For GPG-signed notebooks: same GPG key available
- Expected: Unlock succeeds

### Test Case 2: Different User Attempt
- Different git user.name or user.email
- Expected: HTTP 403 with identity mismatch error

### Test Case 3: GPG Key Unavailable
- Same git user identity but no GPG key access
- Expected: HTTP 403 with GPG key access error

### Test Case 4: Content Modified
- Valid user but notebook content changed since locking
- Expected: HTTP 400 with content integrity error

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Features
1. **Admin Override**: Allow designated administrators to unlock any notebook
2. **Team-based Unlocking**: Support for multiple authorized users per notebook
3. **Time-based Locks**: Automatic unlock after specified duration
4. **Multi-signature Requirements**: Require multiple users to unlock critical notebooks

### Configuration Options
1. **Strict Mode Toggle**: Option to disable strict validation for development environments
2. **Audit Logging Level**: Configurable detail level for security logs
3. **Custom Validation Rules**: Plugin system for organization-specific validation logic

## Conclusion

The enhanced security validation ensures that the git-based notebook locking system provides robust protection against unauthorized access while maintaining usability for legitimate users. The multi-layered approach combining user identity validation, GPG key verification, and content integrity checks provides comprehensive security suitable for enterprise and regulatory environments.
